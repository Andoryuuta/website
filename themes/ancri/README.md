# Ancri
Ancri is a dead-simple hugo theme I created for my [personal blog](https://ando.fyi), to be extended as needed.

# Acknowlegements
This was created following the general outline provided by Pedro Lopez in his post ["Creating a Hugo Theme From Scratch"](https://retrolog.io/blog/creating-a-hugo-theme-from-scratch/).

Some color inspirations were taken from [Hugo Hyde](https://github.com/spf13/hyde) theme.
